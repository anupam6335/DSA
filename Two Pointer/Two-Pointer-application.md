## **Notes on Implementation Patterns:**

1. **Classic Two-Pointer**: Start at ends, move inward
2. **Window Sliding**: Both start at beginning, expand/contract
3. **Fast-Slow Pointers**: Different speeds through sequence
4. **Three Pointers**: Often for partitioning or 3Sum problems
5. **Pointer Chasing**: One pointer follows another's computation
6. **Multi-sequence Pointers**: One per sequence being merged/compared

## **When NOT to Use Two-Pointers:**
- Unordered data (unless you sort first, O(n log n))
- Need to preserve original indices (after sorting)
- Non-linear relationships between elements
- When hash table provides simpler O(n) solution

This list aims to be exhaustive but note that:
1. Many problems have multiple solutions
2. Two-pointer is often combined with other techniques
3. Some "two-pointer" solutions might use more than two pointers
4. The boundary between two-pointer and sliding window is fluid

The technique's essence is using multiple references to traverse data structure(s) efficiently, often reducing time complexity from O(n²) to O(n) or from O(n) to O(log n).
